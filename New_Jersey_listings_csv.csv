Ideally located, youâ€™re close to all the best that New Jersey has to offer! (ID #NYC673)","This furnished apartment is located in Jersey City, just across the Hudson River from Lower Manhattan. Jersey Cityâ€™s bustling waterfront is so packed with office tours that it is affectionately known as â€œWall Street Westâ€ among locals. In all, more than 100,000 people are employed within the city. Jersey City is home to its own thriving international dining scene, including a number of fantastic Vietnamese restaurants and James Beard Award semifinalist Rick Eastonâ€™s Bread &amp; Salt Bakery, where you can try some amazing Roman-style pizza. There are also plenty of shops around Journal Square and Newport Centre, a shopping mall located in nearby Newport. Jersey City has excellent public transportation, with both express and local buses and a light rail system. The entire area is well connected to Manhattan via NJ Transitâ€™s PATH train system, which runs 24/7 between several stops in Jersey City and 33rd Street and the World Trade Center in Manhattan.",https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/prohost-api/Hosting-562142817976478390/original/b6c623e7-e609-48b5-95ed-5dc7c4b28345.jpeg,40.7224587,-74.0354331,Entire rental unit,4,2,2 baths,2,2,"[""Washer \u2013\u00a0In unit"", ""Crib"", ""Wifi"", ""Hot water"", ""Refrigerator"", ""Hair dryer"", ""Shampoo"", ""Patio or balcony"", ""Long term stays allowed"", ""Self check-in"", ""Heating"", ""High chair"", ""Elevator"", ""Bed linens"", ""Private entrance"", ""Pool"", ""Dishwasher"", ""Hangers"", ""TV"", ""Gym"", ""Lockbox"", ""Iron"", ""Dedicated workspace"", ""Air conditioning"", ""Oven"", ""Carbon monoxide alarm"", ""Dryer \u2013\u00a0In unit"", ""Essentials"", ""Microwave"", ""Coffee maker"", ""Smoke alarm"", ""Indoor fireplace"", ""Pets allowed"", ""Kitchen"", ""Bathtub"", ""Cooking basics""]",229,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,t,,New Jersey
